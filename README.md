## Description

This projects goal was to creat a simple dashboard that displayed weather for a searched city
I built this project to practice utilizing 3rd party APIs.
This project connects to OpenWeatherMap to display updated weather for a specific location.
I leanred how to properly manage data recived from third party APIs and manipulate the data in a presentable manner. 

## Installation

no instalation required. Runs in browser. Saves to local storage.

## Usage

Search for a city in the search bar. You may need to be specific if it is a common city name.
The dashboard will display the next upcoming weather reading
The dashboard will display search history saved to local storage in the form ofbuttons that will re-search the city when pressed
The dashboard will display the weather forecast for the next 5 days at noon.
